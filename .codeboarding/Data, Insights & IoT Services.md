## Component Details

This subsystem provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with Twilio's data, insights, and IoT-related services. It leverages a hierarchical structure built upon foundational `Domain` and `Version` components to offer access to various specialized APIs, including those for call analytics (Insights), event streaming (Events), intelligence services (Intelligence), account monitoring (Monitor), bulk data exports (Bulk Exports), and a suite of IoT connectivity solutions (Wireless, Super SIM, Microvisor). The system facilitates the management of diverse data points, real-time events, and embedded device operations through a consistent API client structure.

### Domain
A foundational class representing a Twilio API subdomain (e.g., api.twilio.com). It provides methods for constructing absolute URLs from relative URIs and making HTTP requests (both synchronous and asynchronous) to the Twilio API. It acts as the entry point for interacting with a specific Twilio service.

### Version
This class represents a specific version of a Twilio API (e.g., v1, v2). It extends the Domain functionality by handling version-specific URI construction and providing methods for fetching, updating, deleting, and creating resources, including pagination and streaming capabilities. It also handles error parsing for API responses.
