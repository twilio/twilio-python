    :ivar enabled: Whether the CompositionHook is active. When `true`, the CompositionHook is triggered for every completed Group Room on the account. When `false`, the CompositionHook is never triggered.

A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this property can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` includes tracks named `student` as well as `studentTeam`. Please, be aware that either video_layout or audio_sources have to be provided to get a valid creation request
    :ivar audio_sources_excluded: The array of track names to exclude from the compositions created by the composition hook. A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except for those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this property can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` excludes `student` as well as `studentTeam`. This parameter can also be empty.

See [POST Parameters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#http-post-parameters) for more information. Please, be aware that either video_layout or audio_sources have to be provided to get a valid creation request
    :ivar resolution: The dimensions of the video image in pixels expressed as columns (width) and rows (height). The string's format is `{width}x{height}`, such as `640x480`.
    :ivar trim: Whether intervals with no media are clipped, as specified in the POST request that created the CompositionHook resource. Compositions with `trim` enabled are shorter when the Room is created and no Participant joins for a while as well as if all the Participants leave the room and join later, because those gaps will be removed. See [Specifying Video Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for more info.

For example, `student*` excludes `student` as well as `studentTeam`. This parameter can also be empty.
        :param trim: Whether to clip the intervals where there is no active media in the compositions triggered by the composition hook. The default is `true`. Compositions with `trim` enabled are shorter when the Room is created and no Participant joins for a while as well as if all the Participants leave the room and join later, because those gaps will be removed.

        :param audio_sources_excluded: An array of track names to exclude. A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except for those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this parameter can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` excludes `student` as well as `studentTeam`. This parameter can also be empty.
        :param resolution: A string that describes the columns (width) and rows (height) of the generated composed video in pixels. Defaults to `640x480`.  The string's format is `{width}x{height}` where:   * 16 <= `{width}` <= 1280 * 16 <= `{height}` <= 1280 * `{width}` * `{height}` <= 921,600  Typical values are:   * HD = `1280x720` * PAL = `1024x576` * VGA = `640x480` * CIF = `320x240`  Note that the `resolution` imposes an aspect ratio to the resulting composition. When the original video tracks are constrained by the aspect ratio, they are scaled to fit. See [Specifying Video Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for more info.
        :param format:
        :param status_callback: The URL we should call using the `status_callback_method` to send status information to your application on every composition event. If not provided, status callback events will not be dispatched.
        :param status_callback_method: The HTTP method we should use to call `status_callback`. Can be: `POST` or `GET` and the default is `POST`.
        :param trim: Whether to clip the intervals where there is no active media in the Compositions triggered by the composition hook. The default is `true`. Compositions with `trim` enabled are shorter when the Room is created and no Participant joins for a while as well as if all the Participants leave the room and join later, because those gaps will be removed.
